# Portfolio-3.0


Updating my website/portfolio has been a to-do list item for a long time.

In the meantime, I put together this landing page.

It's grown on me lately, so I'll keep it around and _continuously improve_ on it over time.

# To-Dos

- Upgrade Bootstrap version from 3.3.7 to 4.2 :ghost:
- Improve formatting for mobile
- Dynamically change background color ðŸ¤”
- Add `https`
- Implement service worker & caching
